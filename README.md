# PRTL-mHEM - A Tool for Lightning-Flash-Performance 
PRTL-mHEM is a computational tool capable of simulating the overvoltages obtained during an lightning flash in a structure and presenting the estimated number of outages of the transmission line, including an accurate modeling of the grounding system using mHEM.
